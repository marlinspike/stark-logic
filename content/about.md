## Background

I'm a technologist focused on artificial intelligence, software systems, and building practical tools that actually get used. My work sits at the intersection of modern AI, product engineering, and real-world problem solving.

I've spent my time learning by building: experimenting with models, shipping software, studying how systems scale, and figuring out what makes technology valuable outside of demos and hype.

This site is where I think in public about what I'm learning, what I'm building, and where I think AI and software are heading.

## Areas of Focus

- **Applied AI & Machine Learning** — Designing and experimenting with models, pipelines, and tools that solve concrete problems.
- **Software & Systems Engineering** — Building reliable, maintainable systems with an emphasis on clarity, performance, and scale.
- **Product Thinking** — Turning technical ideas into usable products. Focusing on usability, iteration, and feedback loops.
- **Learning in Public** — Writing to sharpen thinking, document mistakes, and share useful patterns with others.

## Book

My book [*Scaling AI: The Strategic Playbook for Enterprise Transformation*](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-AI-Strategic-Enterprise-Transformation/dp/B0FF7JPZ1M) draws on leadership experience across big tech, startups, global manufacturing, and energy. It covers what it actually takes to move AI past pilots and into production — including the organizational gridlock, data silos, and cultural shifts that most technical guides skip over.

## Philosophy

I believe good technology starts with understanding the problem, not the tool.

AI is powerful, but it only matters when it fits into real workflows, real constraints, and real human needs. I'm interested in building systems that are thoughtful, reliable, and grounded in how people actually work.

Progress comes from curiosity, steady iteration, and being honest about what works and what doesn't.

That's the approach I try to take here.
