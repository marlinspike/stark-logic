I installed 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘄 expecting a weekend rabbit hole.

What surprised me was how quickly it moved from “installed” to “delegated.”

Within the first stretch of tinkering, I had it doing real work asynchronously, the kind of work that usually stalls out because you have to keep shepherding the loop: run a step, watch, paste output, run the next step. With OpenClaw, I could hand it a task, go do something else, and come back to progress. That shift matters more than any single demo.

The second surprise was the interface choice. OpenClaw is designed to live inside the chat apps you already use, not behind a new UI. It can plug into places like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram. I run mine through Telegram. That means I can ping it in the middle of the day and ask, “What did I decide last week?” or “Pull the thread from that meeting,” and it can actually use what I have lying around because I’m a copious note-taker. It makes notes feel like an asset again, not a graveyard.

There’s a deeper pattern here: most coding agents still feel like an event loop with amnesia. You burn tokens, hit a wall, start a fresh chat, and continuity becomes a forced discipline. OpenClaw starts to feel like something else: a system that stays with you over time, picks up habits, and can add skills when it hits a jagged edge. Sometimes that “skill” is literally code.

That power deserves real boundaries. OpenClaw’s own security docs are blunt about the threat model. If you give an agent the ability to run shell commands, read files, and send messages, you have created a new privileged surface area. And the ecosystem is already seeing the predictable follow-on: malicious third-party “skills” and social engineering attempts that try to turn flexibility into a foothold. Tell it to delete all the files on your filesystem and after a few confirmations you may indeed convince it to do so, perhaps killing itself before it finishes. 

So I treat it like a small, powerful machine that I invited into my house. This feels like AI taking on a new form, like Commander Data picking up new skills as it needs.

Mine runs in a sandbox of sorts, on a spare Mac mini dedicated just to it. Limited credentials, a couple LastPass shares, and access to Claude so it can do anything. Use OpenAI's OSS model on OpenRouter for a cheaper but less capable experience. Keep clear trust boundaries. If it ever needs more, that becomes an explicit decision, and it's usually another key or access to information. My friend has it checking himself in on flights already but I'm not that brave yet.

What I take from this is optimistic not alarmist: we’re finally getting agents/tools that feel less like chat and more like delegated execution. This feels a little more like Jarvis and that's pretty cool.
