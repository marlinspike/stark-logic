Greenhouse is how I help organizations move from talking about AI to actually changing how they build.

I work directly with leadership, but only where the conversation quickly moves into real work, with builders and business owners co-located and participating together, not slideware. One of the fastest ways to make that visible is through software delivery itself.

Alongside the team, I helped build an internal application that assembles complex research binders automatically and defined a new workflow where AI and data do the scaling work that once depended on human effort. The technical stack mattered less than the approach. Rather than automate the existing workflow, we rebuilt it from first principles, grounded in working sessions with subject-matter experts, then redesigned it so AI and data could carry the load.
AI was not used as an assistant for snippets or autocomplete, nor was it freeform or improvisational. It was treated the way Andrej Karpathy describes modern AI coding systems: as a highly capable, tireless junior engineer that can translate well-specified intent into concrete implementation at machine speed.

My role shifted from writing every line of code to operating squarely at the senior engineer and architect level. I was responsible for setting system boundaries, defining data contracts and invariants, deciding where responsibility should live, and establishing clear expectations around failure and observability. I reviewed output critically, set acceptance criteria, and made explicit calls about what should and should not be automated. The AI handled the mechanical expansion from specification to code, while accountability for correctness, coherence, and long-term maintainability remained firmly human.

That shift changes velocity, but more importantly, it changes mindset.
Teams that get real value from AI do not lower the bar on code quality or performance. Instead, they shift the primary question from "is every line handcrafted?" to "is the system observable, adaptable, and safe to evolve under change?" The code still has to be correct, readable, and performant, but effort shifts away from bespoke plumbing toward making intent explicit, behavior predictable, and evolution inexpensive.

The biggest barrier is rarely tooling, it’s cultural.

Adopting AI in engineering requires:
• Comfort with describing intent instead of micromanaging implementation
• Discipline around contracts, types, and shared artifacts
• Willingness to instrument early so failures are visible, diagnosable, and actionable rather than silently wrong
• Acceptance that iteration loops get shorter, not more chaotic
Greenhouse exists to make that shift tangible. When leaders see how quickly ideas turn into working systems, the conversation moves from experimentation to operating model.

That is where AI transformation actually begins.
