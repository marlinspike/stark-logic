    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a technologist focused on artificial intelligence, software systems, and building practical tools that actually get used. My work sits at the intersection of modern AI, product engineering, and real-world problem solving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent my time learning by building: experimenting with models, shipping software, studying how systems scale, and figuring out what makes technology valuable outside of demos and hype.</p>
<p>This site is where I think in public about what I&rsquo;m learning, what I&rsquo;m building, and where I think AI and software are heading.</p>
<h2 id="areas-of-focus">Areas of Focus</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied AI &amp; Machine Learning</strong> — Designing and experimenting with models, pipelines, and tools that solve concrete problems.</li>
<li><strong>Software &amp; Systems Engineering</strong> — Building reliable, maintainable systems with an emphasis on clarity, performance, and scale.</li>
<li><strong>Product Thinking</strong> — Turning technical ideas into usable products. Focusing on usability, iteration, and feedback loops.</li>
<li><strong>Learning in Public</strong> — Writing to sharpen thinking, document mistakes, and share useful patterns with others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="book">Book</h2>
<p>My book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-AI-Strategic-Enterprise-Transformation/dp/B0FF7JPZ1M"><em>Scaling AI: The Strategic Playbook for Enterprise Transformation</em></a> draws on leadership experience across big tech, startups, global manufacturing, and energy. It covers what it actually takes to move AI past pilots and into production — including the organizational gridlock, data silos, and cultural shifts that most technical guides skip over.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe good technology starts with understanding the problem, not the tool.</p>
<p>AI is powerful, but it only matters when it fits into real workflows, real constraints, and real human needs. I&rsquo;m interested in building systems that are thoughtful, reliable, and grounded in how people actually work.</p>
<p>Progress comes from curiosity, steady iteration, and being honest about what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the approach I try to take here.</p>
